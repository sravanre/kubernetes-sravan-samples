// Some of the Docker images from this repository are stored in Google Cloud's Artifact Registry (e.g., images referenced by GKE tutorials).
// Such images are rebuilt and repushed to Artifact Registry whenever related changes occur.
// The rebuilding/repushing is done by Google Cloud Build Triggers that we have set up in the "google-samples" Google Cloud project.
// This .tf file describes those Google Cloud Build Triggers and can be used to recreate them (e.g., in case they're accidentally deleted).
// How to use this file:
//     1. Install Terraform.
//     2. From this directory, run "terraform init". This will download the Google Terraform plugin.
//        If you get an error similar to "querying Cloud Storage failed: storage: bucket doesn't exist",
//        try running: gcloud auth application-default login
//     3. Finally, run "terraform apply" to create any missing Google Cloud Build Triggers.
