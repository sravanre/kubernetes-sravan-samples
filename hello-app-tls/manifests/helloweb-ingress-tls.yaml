    #            self-signed certs as in this hello-app-tls example.
    # - "HTTP2": If the backend app supports http2 (hello-app-tls does), use
    #            this to have the load balancer proxy traffic using http2. This
    #            also incudes the "HTTPS" option implicity and provides TLS
    #            between the load balancer and your app.
